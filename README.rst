How to use
==========

Installation
------------

:code:`pip install sunix-ledstrip-controller-client`

Usage
-----

For a basic example have a look at the `example.py <https://github.com/markusressel/sunix-ledstrip-controller-client/blob/master/example.py>`_ file.
If you need more info have a look at the `documentation <http://sunix-ledstrip-controller-client.readthedocs.io/>`_ which should help.

Basic Example
=============

Create the :code:`LEDStripControllerClient` object
--------------------------------------------------

The first thing you need to communicate with any controller is the api client.
Create one like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from sunix_ledstrip_controller_client import LEDStripControllerClient

    api = LEDStripControllerClient()

The next thing you need is a :code:`Controller` object that specifies the basics about your Sunix controller hardware.
You can either let the api search automatically for your controller using:

.. code-block:: python

    devices = api.discover_controllers()

or create one manually like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from sunix_ledstrip_controller_client import Controller
    device = Controller(api, "192.168.2.23")

or including a port if you want to access it from outside of your local network:

.. code-block:: python

    device = Controller(api, "my-dyndns-address.org", 12345)

Note that you have to supply an api object so the Controller can fetch is state.

Turn it on!
-----------

Now you have all that is needed to control your device. It's time to turn it on and off!
Use this method to turn it on:

.. code-block:: python

    device.turn_on()

and this to turn it off:

.. code-block:: python

    device.turn_off()

Make it a rainbow (changing colors)
-----------------------------------

Now to the fun part. The RGB values and the WW (warm white and cold white) value can be adjusted
separately (while keeping the other value) or both at the same time.

All values have a valid range of :code:`0` to :code:`255`.

If you only want to change the RGB values use:

.. code-block:: python

    device.set_rgb(255, 255, 255)

and this one if you only want to change the WW value:

.. code-block:: python

    device.set_ww(255, 255)

To set both at the same time use (you guessed it):

.. code-block:: python

    device.set_rgbww(255, 255, 255, 255, 255)

Functions
---------

The official app for the Sunix controller offers 20 different functions that can be activated and customized in speed.
These functions are hardcoded in the controller so they can not be altered in any way.
You can activate them though using:

.. code-block:: python

    from sunix_ledstrip_controller_client import FunctionId
    device.set_function(FunctionId.RED_GRADUAL_CHANGE, 240)

Function ids can be found in the :code:`FunctionId` enum class.

**0 is slow - 255 is fast.**

In the network protocol the speed is actually reversed (0 is fast, 255 is slow) but I changed this for the sake of simplicity.
You should be aware though that the **speed curve seems to be exponential**. This means 255 is very fast but 240 is
already **a lot** slower.

Custom Functions
----------------

Another feature of the official app is to set a custom color loop with a custom transition and speed between the colors.
Since v1.2.0 of this library you can set those too :)

Simply have a look at the `example_custom_function.py <https://github.com/markusressel/sunix-ledstrip-controller-client/blob/master/example_custom_function.py>`_ file
for a detailed example.

Set/Get Time
------------

The Sunix® controller has a build in clock to be able to execute timer actions.
Currently there is no way to get or set timers with this library.
You can however get and set the current time of the controller.

To get the currently set time use:

.. code-block:: python

    time = device.get_time()

Note that this might be :code:`None` though if you have never set a time for this controller before.
To set a new value use:

.. code-block:: python

    dt = datetime.datetime.now()
    device.set_time(dt)


Attributions
============

I want to give a huge shoutout to `Chris Mullins (alias sidoh) <https://github.com/sidoh>`_ and his
`ledenet_api <https://github.com/sidoh/ledenet_api>`_ library. Although the protocol used by the sunix controller
is not exactly the same to the one used by the LEDENET Magic UFO controller it's quite similar and his work was a
great starting point for me.
