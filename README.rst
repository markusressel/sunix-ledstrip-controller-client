sunix-ledstrip-controller-client
================================

A python library for controlling the SunixÂ® RGB / RGBWWCW WiFi LED Strip controller.

How to use
==========

Installation
------------

:code:`pip install sunix-ledstrip-controller-client`

Usage
-----

For a basic example have a look at the `example.py <https://github.com/markusressel/sunix-ledstrip-controller-client/blob/master/example.py>`_ file.
If you need more info have a look at the `documentation <http://sunix-ledstrip-controller-client.readthedocs.io/>`_ which should help.

Basic Example
=============

Create the :code:`LEDStripControllerClient` object
--------------------------------------------------

The first thing you need to communicate with any controller is the api client.
Create one like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from sunix_ledstrip_controller_client import LEDStripControllerClient

    api = LEDStripControllerClient()

The next thing you need is a :code:`Controller` object that specifies the basics about your Sunix controller hardware.
You can either let the api search automatically for your controller using:

.. code-block:: python

    devices = api.discover_controllers()

or create one manually like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from sunix_ledstrip_controller_client.controller import Controller
    device = Controller("192.168.2.23")

or including a port if you want to access it from outside of your local network:

.. code-block:: python

    device = Controller("192.168.2.23", 12345)

Turn it on!
-----------

Now you have all that is needed to control your device. It's time to turn it on and off!
Use this method to turn it on:

.. code-block:: python

    api.turn_on(device)

and this to turn it off:

.. code-block:: python

    api.turn_off(device)

Make it a rainbow (changing colors)
-----------------------------------

Now to the fun part. The RGB values and the WW (warm white) value can be adjusted
separately (while keeping the other value) or both at the same time.

All values have a valid range of :code:`0` to :code:`255`.

If you only want to change the RGB values use:

.. code-block:: python

    api.set_rgb(device, 255, 255, 255)

and this one if you only want to change the WW value:

.. code-block:: python

    api.set_ww(device, 255)

To set both at the same time use (you guessed it):

.. code-block:: python

    api.set_rgbw(device, 255, 255, 255, 255)

Functions
---------

The official app for the Sunix controller offers 20 different functions that can be activated and customized in speed.
Those are currently not supported by this library but this might change in the future.


Attributions
============

I want to give a huge shoutout to `Chris Mullins (alias sidoh) <https://github.com/sidoh>`_ and his
`ledenet_api <https://github.com/sidoh/ledenet_api>`_ library. Although the protocol used by the sunix controller
is not exactly the same to the one used by the LEDENET Magic UFO controller it's quite similar and his work was a
great starting point for me.
